<p><u>
  1. YOUR RIGHTS TO MAKE CHANGES</u>
  </p>
  <div>
  <p>
  If you wish to make a change to the Tickets you have purchased please contact us as soon as possible. <br>We will let you know if the change is possible. If it is possible, we will let you know about any changes to the price of the Ticket, the timing of the event or anything else which would be necessary as a result of your requested change and ask you to confirm whether you wish to go ahead with the change.
  <br><br>If we cannot make the change or the consequences of making the change are unacceptable to you, you may want to end the Contract (see Clause 3 - Your rights to end the Contract).
</p>
</div>

<br><br>

<p>
<br><u>
  2. DELIVERY OF THE TICKET(S)</u>
</p>
<div>
  <p class="indentext">
  2.1 Our Tickets are digital. You will receive an email when booking through our website.
</p>
<p class="indentext">
  2.2 We are not responsible for delays or changes outside our control. If the Tickets are changed by an event outside our control, that we become aware of, then we will contact you as soon as possible to let you know and we will take steps to minimise the effect of the delay. Provided we do this we will not be liable for delays caused by the change, but if there is a risk of substantial delay you may contact us.
</p>

<p>
  <br>
<u>
3. YOUR RIGHTS TO END THE CONTRACT
</u>
</p>
  <div>
  <p class="indentext">
  3.1 Your rights when you end the Contract will depend on whether you have used the Ticket you have bought, and/or whether we have done something wrong:
</p> <p class="indenttext2">
  a) If you want to end the Contract because of something we have done or have told you we are going to do, see Clause 3.2;
</p><p class="indenttext2">
  b) If what you have bought is not as advertised you may have a legal right to end the Contract (or to get the Ticket replaced or to get some or all of your money back), see Clause 11 – If you have a problem with the Ticket(s).
</p>
<p>
  Due to the nature of the Tickets we sell, please note that you only obtain a right to return in the above circumstances and we are unable to accept any returns if you have simply changed your mind about the Ticket.
</p>
<p class="indentext">
  3.2 Ending the Contract because of something we have done or are going to do. If you are ending a Contract for a reason set out at a) to e) below the Contract will end immediately and we will refund you in full for any Tickets which have not been provided and you may also be entitled to compensation. <br>The reasons are:
</p><p class="indenttext2">
  a) we have told you about an upcoming change to these Terms which you do not agree to (see Clause 3.2);
</p><p class="indenttext2">
  b) we have told you about an error in the price or description of the Ticket you have ordered and you do not wish to proceed (see Clause 12.2);
</p>
<p class="indenttext2">
  c) there is a risk that supply of the Tickets may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control (see Clause 7.4);
</p><p class="indenttext2">
  d) we have suspended supply of the Tickets for technical reasons, or notified you we are going to suspend them for technical reasons, in each case for a period of more than 14 days (See Clause 7.10); or
</p><p class="indenttext2">
  e) you have a legal right to end the contract because of something we have done wrong.
