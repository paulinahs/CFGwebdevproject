## Overview
Final project for the CFG course in Web Dev


### The challenge

After attending the course we should be able to complete a two page website and incorporate:

- HTML & CSS
- Some hover states for interactive elements
- Any framework to ease the coding (I decided to use Bootstrap for the upper nav bar and the homepage slideshow)



### Link

- [Finished website]([https://your-solution-url.com](https://paulinahs.github.io/CFGwebdevproject/homepage.html))


## My process

Started with a wireframe to get an idea of what it is I wanted in the website and to get a feel for the colours to use.
Developed the code from scratch by referencing certain parts of the mock up that I liked.

To give consistency to the website I did use the same structure for the Cities pages. This way the website is cohesive and the pages do not disrupt the flow.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Images from Unsplash


### What I learned

- I learned to research what it is I think could work and see if it exists or how to workaround what I can apply to have the desired effect.
- I know I need to fix the footer so it is similar to the nav bar but the Bootstrap gives me trouble if I use it twice.

### Continued development

- I still have to figure out how to actually be able to submit the form as it just gives a little message right now when "submitted".
- Might need to research how to apply a footer with bootstrap and get a similar feel to the navbar in the top.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) - This helped me Bootstrap and how to adapt it as I wanted to.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Any questions can have an answer here.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Also great for tutorials and getting code snippets to alter.
